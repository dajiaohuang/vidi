# VUE-PLOT Benchmark

VUE-PLOT consists two tracks, **Character** and **Reasoning**. **Character** focuses on real-world videos and assesses fine-grained character perception by requiring models to densely localize the speaking individual and recognize their spoken content. **Reasoning** targets high-level plot understanding and reasoning, challenging models to reason about narrative dynamics, character relationships, and editing techniques through multiple-choice visual question answering on informative video clips. 

## Evaluation

This repository provides evaluation scripts for both tracks of the VUE-PLOT benchmark.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed:

```bash
pip install jiwer
```
You can obtain the raw videos either using the YouTube video IDs or, alternatively, by downloading them from the [Condensed Movies dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/condensed-movies/) homepage.

### 1. Character Understanding Track

This track evaluates the model's ability to localize speakers and recognize their speech in real-world videos.

**Script:** `character_eval.py`

**Usage:**

```bash
python character_eval.py --input_file /path/to/your/results.json
```

**Input Format:**
The input should be a JSON array with one prediction object per video query. Each
object must contain a canonical `video_id` and a `pred` list in the same segment
format used by the bundled result files. The evaluator loads ground truth from
`Character_Grounding/VUE-PLOT_Character_ground_truth.json`; submitted `gt` and
`query_id` values are not used for scoring. Missing canonical videos are scored
as empty predictions, while duplicate or unknown `video_id` values are rejected.

**Metrics:**
- **Temporal IoU**: Average Intersection over Union of matched time segments.
- **Word Error Rate (WER)**: Word distance metrics for speech recognition.
- **Bounding Box IoU**: Spatial localization accuracy of the speaker.

The script outputs a summary of these metrics and saves detailed results to a `results` directory.

### 2. Reasoning Track (VQA)

This track evaluates high-level plot understanding using multiple-choice questions.

**Script:** `vqa_eval.py`

**Usage:**

```bash
python vqa_eval.py --input /path/to/your/results.json
```

**Input Format:**
The input should be a JSON file containing a list of objects with `pred_answer`, `answer`, and `task_type` fields.

**Metrics:**
- **Overall Accuracy**: The percentage of correctly answered questions.
- **Task-Specific Accuracy**: Accuracy broken down by task types such as:
  - Narrative and Structural Understanding
  - Perception and Understanding
  - Professional Filming and Editing Techniques
  - Social Cognition and Knowledge Integration
  - Speech, Audio, and Sound Effect Reasoning
